# DateRange
CSharp Library to create range of dates

If you set a date range between two dates, it can return a simple collection of dates or a group collection of dates based on month or day of the week.

You can set rules to include or exclude day of the week (Mon-Sun) or days (1-31).

This library may help with creating a collection of dates for booking appointments in sequence or payment dates.
